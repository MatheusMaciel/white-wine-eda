# White Wine Exploratory Data Analysis

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis of almost 5.000 variants of Portuguese white wine "Vinho Verde". Each variant is characterized by 11 features plus the wine quality grade.

The EDA involves:
* Identify variable distribution and presence of anomalies or outliers.
* Quantify and visualize variables using appropriate plots.
* Explore and visualize relationship between multiple variables.

This project was part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.
